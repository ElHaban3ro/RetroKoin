# RetroKoin (v1.0)

**RetroKoin** is a **pseudo-cryptocurrency**. Use **RetroKoins** to create a **secure payment system** for your *game*, *store* or *whatever*. **Centrally control** the coins, while maintaining **the typical blockchain** and **proof-of-work** system.


# The Proof of Work
**RetroKoin's** proof of work **is VERY simple**. The encryption system is **RetroKode's own**, called **RetroEncrypt** (more documentation coming soon). The **difficulty** of this is **adjustable**, but remember that the focus of **this pseudo-cryptocurrency** is that it **is easy to mine** and does not require powerful hardware. **It can run** on **Raspberry Pi**, of its simplest models.
